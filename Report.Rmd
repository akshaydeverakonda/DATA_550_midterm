# Analysis of average change in ptc_15d per state

```{r, load-data}
here::i_am("Report.Rmd")
data <- readRDS(
  file = here::here("Output/data_clean.rds")
)
```

## Tabular analysis

A table showing for each state what the average change of the “ptc_15d” variable over the reporting periods included in this document is.

```{r, table}
ptc_15d_table <- readRDS(
  file = here::here("Output/table.rds")
)
print(ptc_15d_table)
```
